# Tap to Talk

**Tap to Talk** is a free, beginner-friendly communication tool designed for adults who cannot speak but can still use their hands. By tapping large, easy-to-use buttons, the app converts selections into spoken words and phrases. This project is built step-by-step so even beginners can follow along and contribute.

## 🎯 Purpose

Many people lose their ability to speak due to accidents, illness, or disability. Commercial AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tools are often too expensive, too complex, or not suited for adults. **Tap to Talk** aims to change that by providing an **accessible, open-source, and customizable communication tool**.
